# DSA-All-Concept
In this repo DSA every concept 2 problems with solution in python we write here.  

In this repo we will work on
## Data Structure 
DS is a format for organizing, processing, retrieving & storing data.

**1 List** => A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of   heterogenous (multiple type of data) elements. 
Using [] we create & represent list.

**2 Tuple** => A tuple is a data structure in Python that is a immutable, or unchangeable, ordered sequence of heterogenous (multiple type of data) elements. 
Using () we create & represent tuple.

**3 Dictionaries** => Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
Dictionary is a collection which is ordered, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
Using {} and have keys and values pair in dictionaries.

**4 Sets** => A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable, and unindexed.
Using {} we create & represent Sets.

**5 Stacks** => A stack is a linear data structure that stores items in a Last-In/First-Out (LIFO) or First-In/Last-Out (FILO) manner. In stack, a new element is added at one end and an element is removed from that end only. The insert and delete operations are often called push and pop.

**6 Queues** => The queue is a linear data structure that stores items in a First In First Out (FIFO) manner. With a queue, the least recently added item is removed first. A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.
